This project presents a Loan Sanction Analysis Dashboard built to understand the key factors that influence loan approval decisions.
Using applicant demographic, financial, and credit data, the analysis focuses on identifying risk patterns, approval drivers, and behavioral indicators that financial institutions rely on when sanctioning loans.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics and visualization can support fair, data-driven lending decisions while minimizing financial risk.
📌 Dashboard Interpretation
 Credit History is the Strongest Approval Indicator
The dashboard shows a significantly higher count of applicants with positive credit history compared to those without. Applicants with credit history = 1 dominate the dataset, confirming that past repayment behavior is the primary driver of loan approval decisions, more than income alone.
Income Distribution is Gender-Skewed
Male applicants contribute 82.88% of total applicant income, while females account for 17.12%.
However, higher income concentration does not automatically translate to guaranteed approval, reinforcing the importance of credit credibility over earnings.
